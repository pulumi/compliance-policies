- Lambda for automated operations

### Application Controls

#### Input Controls

**Status:** ❌ **Not Implemented**

**Requirements:**
- Data validation and verification
- Authorization of input transactions
- Error handling and reporting
- Completeness and accuracy checks

#### Processing Controls

**Status:** ❌ **Not Implemented**

**Requirements:**
- Transaction processing integrity
- Error detection and correction
- Run-to-run balancing
- Audit trail maintenance

#### Output Controls

**Status:** ❌ **Not Implemented**

**Requirements:**
- Output authorization and distribution
- Output review and approval
- Error correction procedures
- Report retention and security

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- [ ] Implement comprehensive audit logging
- [ ] Enable financial data encryption
- [ ] Configure access controls for financial systems
- [ ] Set up backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Enable configuration monitoring

### Phase 2: SOX Controls (Weeks 5-8)
- [ ] Implement separation of duties
- [ ] Configure change management controls
- [ ] Set up automated access reviews
- [ ] Enable real-time monitoring
- [ ] Configure incident response procedures

### Phase 3: Application Controls (Weeks 9-12)

## Policy Implementation Status

### Well Implemented Controls (20% Coverage)
- ✅ Financial Data Integrity (Encryption and backup policies)

### Partially Implemented Controls (40% Coverage)
- ⚠️ Access Controls (Basic IAM needs financial focus)
- ⚠️ Audit Trail Requirements (Basic logging needs SOX enhancement)
- ⚠️ ITGC Logical Access (IAM controls need SOX compliance)
- ⚠️ Computer Operations (Basic monitoring needs SOX focus)

### Not Yet Implemented Controls (40% Coverage)
