# Google Cloud ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Compliance Guide

## Overview

This guide provides detailed implementation guidance for achieving ISO/IEC 27001:2022 compliance on Google Cloud Platform using Pulumi compliance policies.

## ISO 27001 Controls and Google Cloud Implementation

### A.5 Information Security Policies

#### A.5.1 - Policies for Information Security

**Status:** ❌ **Not Implemented**

**Description:** Information security policy and topic-specific policies shall be defined, approved by management, published, communicated to and acknowledged by relevant personnel and relevant interested parties, and reviewed at planned intervals and if significant changes occur.

**Google Cloud Services and Recommendations:**
- **Organization Policy**
  - Centralized policy management and enforcement
  - Hierarchical policy inheritance
  - Custom constraint definitions
  - Policy compliance monitoring

- **Resource Manager**
  - Organizational hierarchy management
  - Project and folder-level policies
  - IAM policy inheritance
  - Resource organization structure

**Implemented Pulumi Policies:**
- None currently implemented for Google Cloud

**Policies Needed:**
- Organization policy enforcement
- Security policy documentation
- Policy compliance validation
- Hierarchical governance structure

### A.8 Asset Management

#### A.8.1 - Responsibility for Assets

**Status:** ❌ **Not Implemented**

**Description:** Assets associated with information and information processing facilities shall be identified and an inventory of these assets shall be drawn up and maintained.

**Google Cloud Services and Recommendations:**
- **Cloud Asset Inventory**
  - Real-time asset discovery and monitoring
  - Resource relationship mapping
  - Export to BigQuery for analysis
  - Historical asset data tracking

- **Cloud Security Command Center**
  - Centralized asset visibility
  - Security findings correlation
  - Asset security posture monitoring
  - Compliance reporting

**Implemented Pulumi Policies:**
- None currently implemented for Google Cloud

**Policies Needed:**
- Asset inventory automation
- Resource labeling enforcement
- Asset classification requirements
- Inventory accuracy validation

### A.10 Cryptography

#### A.10.1 - Cryptographic Controls

**Status:** ❌ **Not Implemented**

**Description:** Policy on the use of cryptographic controls for protection of information shall be developed and implemented.

**Google Cloud Services and Recommendations:**
- **Cloud KMS**
  - Centralized key management
  - Hardware security module support
  - Key rotation automation
  - Envelope encryption capabilities

- **Cloud HSM**
  - FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliance
  - Customer-controlled key management
  - High-performance cryptographic operations
  - Hardware-based key protection

**Implemented Pulumi Policies:**
- None currently implemented for Google Cloud

**Policies Needed:**
- Cloud KMS configuration enforcement
- Encryption-at-rest validation
- Key rotation requirements
- Cryptographic standard compliance

## Policy Implementation Status

### Implemented Controls (0% Coverage)
Currently, no ISO 27001 policies are implemented for Google Cloud. All controls require implementation.

### Priority Implementation Roadmap

### Critical (Immediate Implementation)
1. **A.10.1 - Cryptographic Controls** - Cloud KMS and encryption policies
2. **A.13.1 - Network Controls** - VPC and firewall security policies
3. **A.12.4 - Logging and Monitoring** - Cloud Logging and monitoring policies
